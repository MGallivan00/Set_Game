# Set_Game

This is based off the Trademarked Set Game

A board of 3x4 (12) cards are laid out, and you must select three that follow the rules.
The rules are:
  For each individual attribute all 3 cards must be the same or totally unique
  The attributes are color, number, fill, and shape
  
  Find all sets before the time runs out and win
  The cards get shuffled up every deal and replenish until the deck is empty
  
This was a personal project that took about 2 days of work from a very basic knowledge of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript and from adapting the Memory Mix and Match game walkthrough on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28VfzEiJgy4 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uuQ3g92oPQ
